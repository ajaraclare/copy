<h2>Be Wild Then lets Talk about Wild</h2><br><br>
<P>Wildlife traditionally refers to <b> <i> undomesticated</i> animal species</b></P>
<p> but has come to include all organisms that grow </p>
<p>live wild in an area without being introduced by human</p>
<p>Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems.</p>
<p>Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands,</p>
<p>Other areas, including the most developed urban areas</p>
<p>All have distinct forms of wildlife</p><br>
<h3>Your are the wild; But here is our  <b>W</b>illd</h3>

<h2 id="a">
 <p id="tt">There are five subspecies of this big cat.</p>
<p>It is slim and has muscular, long legs — in relation</p>
<p>to its body size when compared to other cats — a small, rounded</p>
<p>head that is set on a long neck, a flexible spine,</p>
<p>a deep chest, special pads on its feet for traction, and a long</p>
<p>tail for balance. It is also the only cat that cannot </p>
<p>retract its claws, an adaptation to help maintain traction like</p>
<p>a soccer player’s cleats. It also bears distinctive </p>
<p>black “tear tracks” running from the inside corner of each eye to</p>
<p>the mouth that may serve as an anti-glare mechanism for daytime hunting.</p>      <br><br>

<p>Cheetahs tend to encounter conflict with farmers when the</p>
<p>decline of their natural prey leads them to attack livestock,</p>
<p> resulting in farmers killing them in retaliation.</p><b></b><b></b></h2>
